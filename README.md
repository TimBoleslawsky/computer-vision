# Computer Vision

Within this project the basic capabilities of computer vision are demonstrated. These tasks include image classification
and semantic segmentation.

## Setup

To run the project, clone the repository and do the following:

- run uv sync or poetry install to install the dependencies.
- set up a config file in the "configs" directory. An example is provided in the "configs" directory.
- run the project using command "uv run main.py --config "./configs/simple_cnn_classification.yaml".

## Results

The results, aka. the best model, are saved in the "results" directory. A report on the results of the experiment on
image classification is saved here: [Report](reports/image_classification_report.pdf).
